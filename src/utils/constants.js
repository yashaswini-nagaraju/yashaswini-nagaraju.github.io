export const ABOUT_TEXT = `
  My passion for computers started back in high school, where we had just two computer classes each week, but I found myself eagerly looking forward to each one.  
  Those sessions ignited a deep fascination with technology, and it wasnâ€™t long before I realized this was something I wanted to pursue seriously. 
  Thatâ€™s when I decided to pursue my 
  <i>
    <b> Diploma in Computer Science </b>
  </i> 
  right after high school, followed by a 
  <i>
    <b> Bachelorâ€™s in Computer Science Engineering </b> and <b>  Master's degree in Information Technology.</b>
  </i> 

  <br />
  <br />
  Over the years, Iâ€™ve immersed myself in 
  <i>
    <b> Java, Python, and ReactJS </b>
  </i> 
  and theyâ€™ve become my go-to languages. But for me, itâ€™s never just been about codingâ€”it's about the passion that drives it. 
  What started as a spark of curiosity has grown into a fulfilling career, where I channel that excitement into building real-world applications that address meaningful challenges. 
  Every project feels like a new opportunity to dive deeper into technology and make a tangible impact.
